## 📜 Smart Contract Logic

The `FreelanceEscrow.sol` contract manages the job lifecycle:
1. **Creation**: Client deposits MATIC/USDC/DAI into escrow.
2. **Acceptance**: Freelancer stakes 10% as a commitment bond.
3. **Execution**: Work is submitted via IPFS/metadata URI.
4. **Finalization**: Client releases funds, freelancer gets stake back + payment, and an NFT is minted.

## 🛡️ Security

- **ReentrancyGuard**: All fund-transferring functions are protected.
- **Access Control**: Ownable patterns for administrative tasks.
- **Audit**: Comprehensive security notes available in `contracts/AUDIT.md`.

## 📈 Scalability
