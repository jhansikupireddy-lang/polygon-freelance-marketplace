# Environment Variables Setup Guide

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

Your app needs these to work properly. Add them in Vercel Dashboard:

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard**
1. Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: `polygon-freelance-marketplace`
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar

### **Step 2: Add These Variables**

#### **REQUIRED (App won't work without these)**

```env
# WalletConnect Project ID (REQUIRED)
# Get from: https://cloud.walletconnect.com
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Polygon RPC URLs (REQUIRED)
VITE_POLYGON_RPC=https://polygon-rpc.com
VITE_POLYGON_AMOY_RPC=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
```

#### **OPTIONAL (For full features)**

```env
# Biconomy (gasless transactions)
VITE_BICONOMY_API_KEY=

# Huddle01 (video calls)
VITE_HUDDLE_PROJECT_ID=

# Sentry (error tracking)
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=

# The Graph (indexing)
VITE_GRAPH_API_URL=
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy**
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "..." on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

## 🚨 Quick Fix: Use Default Values

If you want to test immediately without getting API keys:

```env
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=demo
VITE_POLYGON_RPC=https://polygon-rpc.com
VITE_POLYGON_AMOY_RPC=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
```

**Note**: Wallet connection won't work with `demo` as Project ID, but the app will load.
